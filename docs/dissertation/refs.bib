  abstract = {This tutorial demystifies one of the most important yet poorly understood aspects of logic programming, the Warren Abstract Machine or WAM. The author's step-by-step construction of the WAM adds features in a gradual manner, clarifying the complex aspects of the design and providing the first detailed study of WAM since it was designed in 1983. Developed by David H. D. Warren, the WAM is an abstract (nonphysical) computer that aids in the compilation and implementation of the Prolog programming language and offers techniques for compiling and optimizing symbolic computing that can be generalized beyond Prolog. Although the benefits of the WAM design have been widely accepted, few have been able to penetrate the WAM. This lucid introduction defines separate abstract machines for each conceptually separate part of the design and refines them, finally stitching them together to make a WAM. An index presents all of the critical concepts used in the WAM. It is assumed that readers have a clear understanding of the operational semantics of Prolog, in particular, of unification and backtracking, but a brief summary of the necessary Prolog notions is provided.

  abstract = {The Warren abstract machine (WAM) has become a generally accepted standard Prolog implementation technique. Garbage collection is an important aspect in the implementation of any Prolog system. A synopsis of the WAM is presented and then marking and compaction algorithms are shown that take advantage of WAM's unique use of the data areas. Marking and compaction are performed on both the heap and the trail; both use pointer reversal techniques, which obviate the need for extra stack space. However, two bits for every pointer on the heap are reserved for the garbage collection algorithm. The algorithm can work on segments of the heap, which may lead to a significant reduction of the total garbage collection time. The time of the algorithms are linear in the size of the areas.},

With this increase in complexity, they require more and more sophisticated memory management. This survey gives an insight into the memory management problems in sequential logic programming language implementations; it also describes the presently known solutions. It is meant to be understood by non-specialists in logic programming with good knowledge of memory management in general. We first describe a ``usefulness logic'' for run-time objects. Usefulness logic defines non-garbage objects. Next, memory management systems are presented from the most trivial original run-time system, with no real concern for memory problems, to elaborated run-time systems with memory management closely observing the usefulness logic. Finally, the choice of a garbage collection technique is discussed in relation with logic programming specificities.},

One interesting consequence is that the TypeScript type system is not statically sound by design. The goal of this paper is to capture the essence of TypeScript by giving a precise definition of this type system on a core set of constructs of the language. Our main contribution, beyond the familiar advantages of a robust, mathematical formalization, is a refactoring into a safe inner fragment and an additional layer of unsafe rules.},

The three authors of this paper present three distinct and complementary points of view, which come together to shape an interactive online book that offers an immersive learning experience. Peter describes the philosophy behind the original book and experiences teaching from it. Jan demonstrates how contemporary web programming has enabled a fully interactive realisation of the book's philosophy. Kacper reports how different technologies can be adopted to build a versatile authoring toolkit that underpins the interactive online edition of the book. Collating these distinct yet coherent perspectives allows us to reflect on future opportunities for interactive Prolog teaching materials arising from the continuous development of web technologies. The insights we offer should be of interest to teachers of Prolog as well as those wanting to find out about the latest educational technologies.},

With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.  Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.},

A large body of research has been gathered over the last 50 years, supported by many Prolog implementations. Many implementations are still actively developed, while new ones keep appearing. Often, the features added by different systems were motivated by the interdisciplinary needs of programmers and implementors, yielding systems that, while sharing the ``classic'' core language, in particular, the main aspects of the ISO-Prolog standard, also depart from each other in other aspects. This obviously poses challenges for code portability. The field has also inspired many related, but quite different languages that have created their own communities. This article aims at integrating and applying the main lessons learned in the process of evolution of Prolog. It is structured into three major parts. First, we overview the evolution of Prolog systems and the community approximately up to the ISO standard, considering both the main historic developments and the motivations behind several Prolog implementations, as well as other logic programming languages influenced by Prolog. Then, we discuss the Prolog implementations that are most active after the appearance of the standard: their visions, goals, commonalities, and incompatibilities. Finally, we perform a SWOT analysis in order to better identify the potential of Prolog and propose future directions along with which Prolog might continue to add useful features, interfaces, libraries, and tools, while at the same time improving compatibility between implementations.},

These handlers are responsible for converting between client and server data representations and typically include options for paginating results. Designing the web accessible API is difficult because it is hard to predict the exact requirements of clients. Pengines changes this picture. The client provides a Prolog program that selects the required data by accessing the logical API of the server. The pengine infrastructure provides general mechanisms for converting Prolog data and handling Prolog non-determinism. The Pengines library is small (2000 lines Prolog, 150 lines JavaScript). It greatly simplifies defining an AJAX based client for a Prolog program and provides non-deterministic RPC between Prolog processes as well as interaction with Prolog engines similar to Paul Tarau's engines.

Partial deductors are often cited in the literature with little explanation of their type, quality, or general applicativeness. Further, there is no taxonomy by which partial deduction systems can be characterized and compared. This paper describes progress towards solving this problem. Five partial deduction systems for (pure) Prolog are studied. Their general control structures are analyzed, with concentration on their solutions to the issues of when or what to unfold, when to terminate unfolding, and how to pass multiple solutions between subgoals. Seven sample programs are tested using the five partial deductors. Qualitative and quantitative measures of the residual programs are taken. The final results are a comparison of the partial deductors and their performance, and an initial taxonomy for partial deduction systems for (pure) Prolog.},

  abstract = {Traditional Prolog implementations are based on the stack/heap memory architecture: the stack holds local variables and control information, whereas the heap stores data objects which outlive procedure activations. A stack frame can be deallocated when an activation ends while heap space can only be reclaimed on backtracking or by garbage collection. Conventional garbage collection methods may yield poor performance. In this paper, I present a novel memory management approach used in the implementation of Logic Virtual Machine (LVM). The LVM combines the stack and the heap into a single memory block for all dynamical memory requirements, supports coarse-grain two-stream uni cation, and embeds an e cient garbage collection algorithm, the Chronological Garbage Collection (CGC), to reclaim useless memory cells. An experimental LVM emulator has been implemented. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach has low runtime overhead, good virtual memory and cache performance, and very short, evenly distributed pause times during garbage collection. Some benchmarks even revealed that the CGC not only improves the program's cache performance by more than enough to pay its own cost, but also improves the program execution performance which is competitive with the SICStus fastcode.},

  abstract = {Various Prolog systems can be classified into two categories: Structure Sharing (SS) and Structure Copying (SC). The fundamental distinction between SS and SC is the way in which they represent structures. SS represents a structure instance by a two-pointer molecule with one end toward the structure skeleton and the other toward a binding environment. On the other hand, SC makes a concrete copy of a structure whenever the structure is matched against a free variable. SS was used in earlier Prolog implementations, whereas SC has been accepted as the de facto standard in modern Prolog implementations. However, analysis and practical comparison of SS and SC claim that programs can be written that make any one method almost arbitrarily worse than the other. In this paper, I propose a new Prolog term representation approach: Program Sharing (PS). The major contribution of this work is that PS has the advantages of both SC (representing terms of different types to fit in the size of a machine word) and SS (low overhead in constructing a dynamic structure instance), and the concept of program sharing could be used to realize all-special-case instruction-driven unification. PS has been adopted in the design of a new Prolog abstract machine, the LAM12. I have implemented an experimental LAM12 emulator in C. Benchmarks show that this new approach is very promising in memory utilization and reasonably close to a very good SC-based system in performance.},

  abstract = {The prosperous trend of deploying complex applications to web browsers has boosted the development of WebAssembly (wasm) compilation toolchains. Software written in different high-level programming languages are compiled into wasm executables, which can be executed fast and safely in a virtual machine. The performance of wasm executables depends highly on compiler optimizations. Despite the prosperous use of wasm executables, recent research has indicated that real-world wasm applications are slower than anticipated, suggesting deficiencies in wasm optimizations. This paper aims to present the first systematic and in-depth understanding of the status quo of wasm optimizations. To do so, we present Ditwo, a differential testing framework to uncover missed optimizations (MO) of wasm optimizers. Ditwo compiles a C program into both native x86 executable and wasm executable, and differentiates optimization indication traces (OITraces) logged by running each executable to uncover MO. Each OITrace is composed with global variable writes and function calls, two performance indicators that practically and systematically reflect the optimization degree across wasm and native executables. Our analysis of the official wasm optimizer, wasm-opt, successfully identifies 1,293 inputs triggering MO of wasm-opt. With extensive manual effort, we identify nine root causes for all MO, and we estimate that fixing discovered MO can result in a performance improvement of at least 17.15\%. We also summarize four lessons from our findings to deliver better wasm optimizations.},

In turn, the use of a very high-level language facilitates the development of high-quality, complex software. The compiler is a back end of the Ciao system and supports most of its features, including its module system and its rich language extension mechanism based on packages. We present an overview of the compilation process and a detailed description of the run-time system, including the support for modular compilation into separate JavaScript code. We demonstrate the maturity of the compiler by testing it with complex code such as a CLP(FD) library written in Prolog with attributed variables. Finally, we validate our proposal by measuring the performance of some LP and CLP(FD) benchmarks running on top of major JavaScript engines.},

Space is saved by making it possible to deallocate the intermediate cells. This is particularly useful when those cells are associated with frozen goals. 2. Later dereferencing is speeded up by not having to follow long variable chains. The main complication of this optimization is the treatment of the trailed variables. We claim that all possible chains of variables are shunted by this algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented in SICStus Prolog, and benchmark results are presented in this paper.

  abstract = {Physical device fingerprinting exploits hardware features to uniquely identify a machine. This technique has been used for authentication, license binding, or attackers identification, among other tasks. More recently, hardware features have also been introduced to identify web users and perform web tracking. A particular type of hardware fingerprint exploits differences in the computer internal clock signals. However, previous methods to test for these differences relied on complex experiments performed by running native code in the target machine. In this paper, we show a new way to compute a hardware finger- printing, based on timing the execution of sequences of instructions readily available in API functions. Due to its simplicity, this method can also be performed remotely by simply timing few seemingly innocuous lines of JavaScript code. We tested our approach with different functions, such as common string manipulation or widespread cryptographic routines, and found that several of them can be used as basic blocks for fingerprinting. Using this technique, we implemented a tool called CryptoFP. We tested its native implementation in a homogeneous scenario, to distinguish among a perfectly identical (both in software and hardware) set of computers. CryptoFP was able to correctly discriminate all the identical computers in this scenario and recognize the same computer also under different CPU load configurations, outperforming every other hardware fingerprinting method. We then show how CryptoFP can be implemented using a combination of the HTML5 Cryptography API and standard timing API for web device fingerprinting. In this case, we compared our method, both in the same homogeneous scenario and by performing an experiment with real-world users running heterogeneous devices, against other state-of-the-art web device fingerprinting solutions. In both cases, our approach clearly outperforms all existing methods.},

Static generation of multi-argument indexing is one alternative, but applications often rely on features that are inherently dynamic which makes static techniques inapplicable or inaccurate. Another alternative is to employ dynamic schemes for flexible demand-driven indexing of Prolog clauses. We propose such schemes and discuss issues that need to be addressed for their efficient implementation in the context of WAM-based Prolog systems. We have implemented demand-driven indexing in two different Prolog systems and have been able to obtain non-negligible performance speedups: from a few percent up to orders of magnitude. Given these results, we see very little reason for Prolog systems not to incorporate some form of dynamic indexing based on actual demand. In fact, we see demand-driven indexing as only the first step towards effective runtime optimization of Prolog programs.},

No dedicated code area is used as the code is placed directly on the heap. Unification and indexing operations are orthogonal. Filtering of matching clauses happens without building new structures on the heap. Variables in function and predicate symbol positions are handled with no performance penalty. A simple Englishlike syntax is used as an intermediate representation for clauses and goals and the same simple syntax can be used by programmers directly as an alternative to classic Prolog syntax. Solutions of (multiple) logic engines are exposed as answer streams that can be combined through typical functional programming patterns, with flexibility to stop, resume, encapsulate and interleave executions. Performance of a basic interpreter implementing our design is within a factor of 2 of a highly optimized compiled WAM-based system using the same host language.},

Attributed variables allow for creating infinite lazy datastructures. We prove that such datastructures have great practical value and their introduction requires `precise' garbage collection.

  abstract = {Recently, we see a new type of interfaces for programmers based on web technology. For example, JSFiddle, IPython Notebook and R-studio. Web technology enables cloud-based solutions, embedding in tutorial web pages, atractive rendering of results, web-scale cooperative development, etc. This article describes SWISH, a web front-end for Prolog. A public website exposes SWI-Prolog using SWISH, which is used to run small Prolog programs for demonstration, experimentation and education. We connected SWISH to the ClioPatria semantic web toolkit, where it allows for collaborative development of programs and queries related to a dataset as well as performing maintenance tasks on the running server and we embedded SWISH in the Learn Prolog Now! online Prolog book.},

This paper tells the story of the creation, design, evolution, and standardization of the JavaScript language over the period of 1995--2015. But the story is not only about the technical details of the language. It is also the story of how people and organizations competed and collaborated to shape the JavaScript language which dominates the Web of 2020.},

  abstract = {WebAssembly is the newest language to arrive on the web. It features a compact binary format, making it fast to be loaded and decoded. While WebAssembly is generally expected to be faster than JavaScript, there have been mixed results in proving which code is faster. Little research has been done to comprehend WebAssembly's performance benefit. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to understand the performance of WebAssembly applications and compare it with JavaScript. Our measurements were performed on three sets of subject programs with diverse settings. Among others, our findings include: (1) WebAssembly compilers are commonly built atop LLVM, where their optimizations are not tailored for WebAssembly. We show that these optimizations often become ineffective for WebAssembly, leading to counter-intuitive results. (2) JIT optimization has a significant impact on JavaScript performance. However, no substantial performance increase was observed for WebAssembly with JIT. (3) The performance of WebAssembly and JavaScript varies substantially depending on the execution environment. (4) WebAssembly uses significantly more memory than its JavaScript counterparts. We hope that our findings can help WebAssembly tooling developers identify optimization opportunities. We also report the challenges encountered when compiling C benchmarks to WebAssembly and discuss our solutions.},

  abstract = {We present Emscripten, a compiler from LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) assembly to JavaScript. This opens up two avenues for running code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web: (1) Compile code directly into LLVM assembly, and then compile that into JavaScript using Emscripten, or (2) Compile a language's entire runtime into LLVM and then JavaScript, as in the previous approach, and then use the compiled runtime to run code written in that language. For example, the former approach can work for C and C++, while the latter can work for Python; all three examples open up new opportunities for running code on the web.Emscripten itself is written in JavaScript and is available under the MIT license (a permissive open source license), at http://www.emscripten.org. As a compiler from LLVM to JavaScript, the challenges in designing Emscripten are somewhat the reverse of the norm - one must go from a low-level assembly into a high-level language, and recreate parts of the original high-level structure of the code that were lost in the compilation to low-level LLVM. We detail the methods used in Emscripten to deal with those challenges, and in particular present and prove the validity of Emscripten's Relooper algorithm, which recreates high-level loop structures from low-level branching data.},
